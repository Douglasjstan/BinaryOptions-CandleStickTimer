# BinaryOptions-CandleStickTimer

Tick timer is very important in trading Binary Options.  This indicator (I called VLineTimer) uses your computer real time clock to compute the remaining time of a candle. It does not depend on Tick Data to refresh. Therefore, you will be able to see the remaining time of a candle even there is no tick information.
There is also a vertical dotted line (which you can disable) to help you read the chart if you have indicator running on your indicator window.
